#First Wordpress Theme
======================
This repo is my first attempt at creating a Wordpress theme. I used this tutorial to understand the basics https://www.taniarascia.com/developing-a-wordpress-theme-from-scratch/. The theme is based of the Bootstrap Blog template http://getbootstrap.com/examples/blog/. The idea is to learn from the tutorial and template, and then expand to make it my own. 

To see the theme in action download and put in your Wordpress themes folders, and apply to the Wordpress site.
